<h3> Final Project proposal: </h3>
Every year, millions of road accidents occur across the United States, causing tens of thousands of deaths and significant economic damage. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, 2025), **over 39,000 people die in traffic-related incidents annually**, while organizations such as the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimate the economic cost of crashes at more than $870 billion per year due to emergency services, property damage, medical expenses, and traffic delays.

Among the many factors analyzed in traffic incident reports, **accident severity**, which measures the seriousness of an incident—is particularly important. It determines the scale of response required, the risk to life and infrastructure, and the long-term implications for policy and public safety planning. **Yet, in most real-world systems, severity is only recognized after the fact.**

This leads to a central question:  
> **Can we predict the severity of an accident in real-time using environmental, temporal, and infrastructural data?**. </br> </br>
